This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP related to loose comparisons when handling function return values. The `bug.php` file shows the erroneous code, where a function might return NULL or FALSE, but the loose comparison `==` fails to accurately distinguish between them. The `bugSolution.php` file provides the corrected version using strict comparison `===`. Loose comparison in PHP (`==`) does type juggling; Strict comparison (`===`) does not.
